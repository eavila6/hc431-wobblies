                    <p>The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) formed in 1905 is an important early 20th century American union predominantly characterized by their revolutionary beliefs for the time.
                        As a result, the members of the IWW, the Wobblies, were always a disruption to the status quo and the plans of their fellow unions—
                        such as the American Federation of Labor (AFL), one of the largest union organizations at the time— as they fought for workers’ rights largely due to the innovative strategies they employed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike other unions, the Wobblies were all-inclusive and targeted the workers neglected by the mainstream.
                        The Wobblies understood the importance and role of worker solidarity when it came to making a push for work-life improvement.
                        All workers from varying skill levels, ethnic backgrounds, skin tone, etc. were welcomed into the Wobbly ranks with open arms.
                        Despite the times they fell short at making all of their members’ voices heard—
                        a rather difficult crease to iron out due to union workers representing minorities generally being few and far between during this time period and the Wobblies did sometimes lose themselves in the heat of the moment—
                        the Wobblies’ open arms is one of their best traits.
                        It’s as a result of their willingness to provide a platform and a microphone for the marginalized that makes the Wobblies so important in the history of labor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the more relevant pieces of ideology that came out of the Wobblies is probably Elizabeth Gurley Flynn’s pamphlet
                        <em>Sabotage</em>, an article about all the violent ways an ordinary worker could make their demands heard in the form of their actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, you don’t sabotage for the sake of it: you do it to send a message.
                        If you don’t put purpose behind what you do, you’re no better off than those who exploit you, Flynn argues.
                        Once this moral conundrum is resolved, the ways you can screw around with your employer are nearly limitless.
                        Many of you reading this might’ve engaged in this type of violence before: malicious compliance with unreasonable demands to highlight their absurdity, clocking in and out exactly on time, interfering with the quality of goods (i.e. spitting in food), and openly complaining about your workplace are some good examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s very easy to engage in violent acts, but it takes a lot of skill in order to use it for good.
                        It’s never ok to be excessively cruel but the lines between acceptable levels of violence are very blurred.
                        Ultimately, violence is a tool to help you propel yourself towards a brighter future, but it can easily make things go horribly wrong.
